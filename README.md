### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer that was training to be a Data Scientist but fell in love with engineering. The best model in the world doesn't help anyone if its not deployed into a system that solves a business problem. Maintainable and well written code makes everyones lives better on top of being intrisically valuable (in my humble opinion).
